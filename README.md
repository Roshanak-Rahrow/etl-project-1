You have been approached by a local Café chain to help them explore moving from their paper-based Order Record System to a Local Database System.

They have asked that you use a Microsoft Windows or MAC infrastructure.

Using Python, Docker and a MySQL database, build a simple data pipeline made up of ‘Extract’, ‘Transform’ and ‘Load’ functions that will extract information from a CSV data source, clean the data of any incorrect or badly formed records and remove any PII (Card Number, Name etc..) then upload it to a Local MySQL database for storage.

Your application must have the ability to print to the screen, clear the screen, accept user input, and allow them to trigger the Extract’, ‘Transform’ and ‘Load’ functions of the ETL Pipeline manually.

They wish you to design, two different User Interfaces they could use, to get an idea of how they will use it when it goes live, they want you as a minimum to create a simple CLI based menu as well as a Windows GUI menu as a POC (Proof of Concept) for it.

The record structure and data types you need to consider, should be based on the following record structure.

Products - Customer Name, Drink, Qty, Price, Branch, Payment Type, Card Number, Date/Time
